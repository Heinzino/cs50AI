Varialbes TO Manipulate

    #Convolution
    -Size of Kernel
    -numFilters

    #Pooling
    -PoolSize

    #Num of Hidden Layers

    #DropoutRate


Default Values: 
SizeOfKernal = (3,3) ; numFilters = 20, poolsize=(2,2)

Experiments:

1. Default Values ~ 85% Accuracy

2. Size of Kernal
    (4,4) -> Cycles between high accuracy of 95 to 86 not consistent
    (2,2) ~ 50% Accuracy
    Sticking with default Values

3. numFilters
    32 ~ 90% accuracy
    64 ~ 90% accuracy
    128 ~ 95% accuracy
    Going with 32

4. Pooling Size
    (3,3) ~ 78% accuracy
    (4,4) ~ 83% accuracy
    Sticking with default values

5. Extra Convultion + Pooling Layer (32 numFilters rest default)
    Consistent 88% accuracy average
    Going with two convultion + pooling layer; More computation

6. DropoutRate
    0.4 ~ 90% accuracy
    0.3 ~ Averages about 87%, has high swings
    0.2 ~ 75% accuracy
    0.6 ~ 88% accuracy

    Sticking with 0.4
